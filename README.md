# NYC-CitiBike

## Project Overview
I was tasked with analyzing New York City CitiBike data from August 2019 to determine if CitiBike would be a good fit for Des Moines, Iowa. The New York City data was analyzed to show trends for popular checkout times, days of the week, gender, peak hour usage, and bike utilization. Visualizations were created to illustrate the length of time the bikes are checked out for all riders and genders, the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week, the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week, peak hours the bikes were used during the month of data that was analyzed (August 2019), and which bikes are used most (to see which may require maintenance).

## Results of NYC CitiBike Data 

#### The majority of bikes were used for approximately 5 minutes, with nearly all rides timing in at less than 60 minutes.

#### Males represent the majority of bike users, although the pattern of duration appears similar regardless of gender.

#### Riders by Gender

#### There is a higher concentration of rides during the traditional morning and evening rush hour periods (6a - 10a and 4p - 7p). Again, we can see there is a higher number of male riders.

#### Subscriber rides far outnumber those by non-subscribers with the heaviest use occuring on Thursdays by male subscribers.

#### As previously noted, the peak hours of rides occurs during morning and evening commutes. The overnight hours from 2a -5a have by far the least rides. This may be an opportune time for regular bike maintenance.

#### Some bikes receive far more use than others. The darker colors indicate those which are used most while the light color represents those with the fewest number of rides.  It may be worth researching why some bikes are used far more than others.

## Summary
As illustrated in the visualizations, males were the primary users of CitiBike in New York City during August 2019. The most usage occurred on Thursdays and peak bike usage occurred during traditional morning and evening rush hours. Additional analysis will be required to determine if CitiBike is a good fit for Des Moines, Iowa.
When determining if CitiBike would be a good fit for Des Moines, Iowa, analysts should visualize population growth between the two cities. Publicly available census data could be used to look at populations and growth rates. If population growth for Des Moines is greater than New York City's, the CitiBike has potential in Des Moines.
An additional visualization that may help investors determine if CitiBike is a good fit for Des Moines would compare weather data between Des Moines and New York City. Both cities have four distinct seasons, so if temperatures and weather are similar, then a stronger case may be made to investors that CitiBike would be a good fit for Des Moines, Iowa.
